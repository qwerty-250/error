Prototype Demonstration, Feedback Plan,  Non-Technical Survey, Technical Survey,  Feedback Evaluation
Task 3a: Feedback Plan
Introduction
For my feedback collection, I will be using two different surveys, one aimed at technical users (people with programming knowledge) and one aimed at non-technical users (general users).
The advantage of this approach is that it allows me to gather two perspectives: feedback from regular users about usability and design, and more detailed technical feedback from programmers regarding functionality and code quality.
Both surveys will cover similar topics regarding the web app's user experience and design, but the technical survey will include an additional section focused on the program's internal functionality, efficiency, and technical improvements.
The technical respondents will also be given supervised access to the source code and the web app itself, so they can suggest improvements and highlight any issues more effectively.

User Demonstrations
To make sure all users understand how to use the web app properly, I will create a set of clear, simple demonstrations showing how to perform key actions.
This is important because it ensures that all users know how to use the main features, leading to more accurate and useful feedback instead of confusion or misunderstandings.
For example:
How to login:
1.Go to the "Account" page.
2.Enter the requested data.
3.Submit the data.
4.You should be directed to your Account page.
These demonstration materials will help users understand how the app works before completing the survey, improving the quality of their feedback.



Questionnaires
The surveys will be created using Microsoft Forms because it is a simple, efficient tool that offers useful features for creating forms, like branching questions and automatic graphs.
The survey will be divided into two versions:
Non-Technical User Survey: focusing on UI, UX, and the functionality of each page.
Technical User Survey: covering the same as the Non-Technical but also deeper technical aspects such as code quality, variable naming, structure, and error handling.
Both surveys will collect quantitative and qualitative feedback.
Respondents
The respondents will not need to provide personal information such as their name or email.
This helps build trust and encourages more honest responses. (expand this section)
Technical Section
The technical version of the survey will include specific questions about the functionality, efficiency, and readability of the code.
Examples of technical questions include:
Were the naming conventions (variables, functions) clear and easy to understand?
Were there any technical errors? If yes, what were they?
How could the code be improved for better scalability or readability?
Supervised access to the project and its source code will be given to technical users to help them provide more detailed feedback. 
Stages (expand stages just a bit)
Stage 1: Create instruction documents (user demonstrations) to guide users through the main functions of the web app.
Stage 2: Create two Microsoft Forms surveys (one for technical users, one for non-technical users).
Stage 3: Collect feedback using the surveys, gathering both quantitative and qualitative data. 
Stage 4: Analyze the feedback, summarize it in a Word document using graphs (for quantitative data) and written evaluation (for qualitative insights).
Stage 5: Use the findings to plan and document future improvements to the web app.
Question Structure
The survey questions will be organized based on the different sections or pages of the web app. 
-UI Questions (Accessibility, Readability, Design Aesthetics)
-UX Questions (Navigation, Functionality, User Satisfaction)
-Account page
-Advice page
-Login and Registration page
-Appointments page
-Products page
-TECHNICAL Section for technical users 
Example of a question structure:
UX Question:
On a scale from 1 to 10, how easy was it to navigate to the Weather page?
For the technical survey, additional questions like:
Were you able to understand the purpose of the functions by reading their names?
Did the comments in the code help you understand the structure?
Outcome
Through obtaining input from both technical and non-technical users, I will be able to pinpoint a variety of enhancements, ranging from improving the user interface and user experience to streamlining the functionality and underlying code structure. This two-pronged feedback strategy will guarantee that the web application is thoroughly assessed from the viewpoints of both developers and users, enabling me to make informed, focused changes that address both technical quality and usability. The outcomes of this feedback procedure will be crucial for improving the project's final draft.

Demo 
This document visualises the answers to the questionnaires, and details what can be taken from the responses that users gave. The purpose of this is to understand what worked and didn’t work with the prototype, to help later evaluate the solution that has been developed. This is a link to the original Microsoft Forms Survey, where all the answers can be shown:
---
---
Table of contents:
---

Notes:
I have made new charts and graphs (example: pie charts that contain all of the answers from both surveys on that specific question) to combine the responses from the technical and non-technical surveys, even though Microsoft Forms provides for the construction of its own. Responses that are identical have been grouped to save time and space. Nevertheless, I feel like this approach provides more insight and more meaningful data then the charts from Microsoft Forms that can be a bit vague for specific kind of questions.
